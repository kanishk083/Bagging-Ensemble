# Bagging Ensemble Learning (Classifier & Regressor)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** Ensemble techniques for both **classification** and **regression** tasks using **scikit-learn**.  
It includes experiments with various base estimators such as **Decision Tree**, **Linear Regression**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors**, along with **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

##  Overview

**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** is an ensemble learning method that improves the stability and accuracy of machine learning models by combining multiple instances of the same model trained on different random subsets of the data.  
It helps reduce variance and prevent overfitting.

This project includes:
- **BaggingClassifier** for classification tasks  
- **BaggingRegressor** for regression tasks  
- **Base Models:** Decision Tree, Linear Regression, KNN  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** using GridSearchCV  
- **Performance Evaluation** wit
